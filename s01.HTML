  song# We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think
  we can't we'll always find a way that's why the people of this world believe in <strong>Garnet, Amethyst and Pearl And <u>Steven!</u></strong>
  <p>Noooooooo! This can't be happening!
  This has to be a dream! Lars! Lars! Please tell me I'm dreaming!
  Get off me, man.
  I'm stocking here.
  I'm sorry, Steven.
  I guess they stopped making them.
  Stopped making them?!<br>
  Why in the world would they stop making Cookie Cats?!
  They're only the most scrumptious and delicious ice-cream
  sandwich ever made! Don't they have laws for this?! Tough bits, man.
  Nobody buys them anymore.<br>
  I guess they couldn't compete with Lion Lickers.
  Not Lion Lickers! Nobody likes them!
  They don't even look like Lions! Kids these days I'll tell you what!
  Well, if you miss your wimpy ice cream so much, why don't you make some
  with your magic belly button? <br>That's not how it works, Lars.Right?
  Oh, sweet Cookie Cats, with your crunchy cookie outside,
  your icy creamy insides, you were too good for this world.
  Uh Steven? Do you want to take the freezer with you?</p>

  <p>Hey guys, you won't believe this! 'Sup, Steven? Awesome!
  What are these things? Ugh! Sorry, Steven.
  We'll get these centipeetles out of your room.
  We think they were trying to get into the temple.
  Aw.
  You don't have to get rid of them.
  They're really cool.<br>
  Um, you guys? These things don't have gems.
  That means there must be a mother somewhere nearby.
  We should probably find it before anyone gets hurt.
  Ooh! Ooh! Can I come?! Can I?! Can I?! Steven, until you learn
  to control the powers in your gem,
  we'll take care of protecting humanity, okay?<br> Aw, man.
  Hey! Get out of there! Go on! Shoo! Shoo! Aw!
  They got into everything! Not cool! No way.
  I-It can't be! Wha Where did you get these?!
  I thought they stopped making them! Well, we heard that, too,
  and since they're your favorite We went out and stole a bunch.<br>
  I went back and paid for them.
  The whole thing was my idea.
  It was everyone's idea.Not really.
  All that matters is that Steven is happy.</p>
